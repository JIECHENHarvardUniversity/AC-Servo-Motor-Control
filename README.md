# AC-Servo-Motor-Control
# This project is developed to facilitate motion control of AC servo motors through C++

The AC servo motors we used belong to the Panasonic Minas A5 series. 
The Motion controller we used is the GE-800-PV from Googol Technology, which can drive 8 motors simultaneously. 
Both position control and velocity control have been developed for this project.
